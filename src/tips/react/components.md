# Components

- React components are JavaScript functions that return JSX (a syntax similar to HTML) that tells React what to render
- Remember to use a return statement for components!
- Use Pascal Case for component names e.g. UserList, ProductCard, ActivityFeed, etc.
- Best practice is to have a separate file for each of your components
- Remember to <code>export default ComponentName</code> at the end of the component
